    description: Genetic diagnosis of muscular dystrophies (MDs) has classically been guided by clinical presentation, muscle biopsy, and muscle MRI data. Muscle MRI suggests diagnosis based on the pattern of muscle fatty replacement. However, patterns overlap between different disorders and knowledge about disease-specific patterns is limited. Our aim was to develop a software-based tool that can recognize muscle MRI patterns and thus aid diagnosis of MDs.

# Bio

Hello! I'm a programmer, aspiring Data Scientist and Artificial Intelligence enthusiast. I have a broad field of interests, including machine/deep learning, image processing, cybersecurity, gaming, music production, photography and graphic design. I love finding problems and creating solutions, always willing to try and learn new technologies. My Open Source ethic pushed me to create this website, a place where I can share my work and inspire/help anyone.

I'm currently working for the [University of Newcastle][1], in the [John Walton Muscular Dystrophy Research Centre][2], applying AI and other programming-based techniques to medical data.
